# Massively Parallel CNN in CUDA
This project explores typical optimizations for massively parallel convolution on a GPU. Each file in `optimizations` showcases a different optimization technique accompanied by a brief description. To test a specific kernel, copy and paste it into the `src/layer/custom` folder before beginning.
- Note: The project utilizes the Eigen library and the `src` folder has been adapted from earlier academic work.
